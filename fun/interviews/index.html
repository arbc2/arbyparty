    <h1>interviews</h1>

    <p>this series is focused on the construction of film as a visual medium<br>unlike traditional interviews, these are conducted by email and are cut up into a visual format. <br>
    all text in said emails remains, only repurposed to show how construction creates meaning</p>

    <p>Here's how to make a list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First thing</li>
      <li>Second thing</li>
      <li>Third thing</li>
      <li>First thing</li>
      <li>Second thing</li>
      <li>Third thing</li>
      <li>First thing</li>
      <li>Second thing</li>
      <li>Third thing</li>
    </ul>
